Added parsing of VictSensor-msg. Nothing is done with this information (yet). Had to change Base/Sensor.vb with a check if a key already exists. Change can have side-effects. Tested both on UsarSim 3.11 (DM-VictTest) and arena-loop.log.

Tried to add rendering of Victims. Partly solved. Tried to render in a specific layer, but I cannot control the layer. Commented out the link to specific layer, so code should still work. (Tested on DM-VictTest)

Since Tijn got all ImageServer related functionality to work, I have decided to merge his work into the core framework classes:
- merged CameraDriver into LiveDriver
- merged CameraAgent into Agent
- renamed FrameData to CameraData for consistency (the xxxSensor has xxxData, so CameraSensor has CameraData)


Also refactored the TcpConnection class, also to pave the way for future work on WSS by Luis:
- two types of connections are distinguished
- MessagingConnection is for text-based communication as between the Agent and UsarSim
- CameraConnection is for the ImageServer, where sent messages are plain text (e.g. acknowledgements) and the incoming data are images
- they both derive from the by now well-known TcpConnection class which has transformed into a regular base class

Other then that I also found and fixed some bugs in the image recieving logic.

Refactored and extended Sensor model:
- MessageType enum describes what kind of message was recieved (sensor/status/response/configuration/...)
- added InsSensor (new in UsarSim 3, seems to replace INU, maintains x,y,z and roll,pitch,yaw)
- added StatusSenor, gives several pieces of information of which only the Battery is of interest

Modified base Agent class:
- Agent now mounts GroundTruthSensor and StatusSensor by default

Also modified AgentController view so that it displays the ground-truth and battery status.

Got confused!

For my own clarity:
- renamed VictimSensor of 2006 to VictimRfidSensor (put the RFID in the name to make its working obvious)
- renamed VictSensor of 2007 to VictimSensor (since it works with 'real victim', and not with the RFIDs)

Protection against Theseus-bug. Theseus-bug originated in the config-file, which specified ground-truth as seed.

This protection prevents that the offset is stored in the origin, independent where this origin is coming from. Has some side-effect, but should be save during the competition

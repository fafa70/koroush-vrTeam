Added parsing of VictSensor-msg. Nothing is done with this information (yet). Had to change Base/Sensor.vb with a check if a key already exists. Change can have side-effects. Tested both on UsarSim 3.11 (DM-VictTest) and arena-loop.log.

Since Tijn got all ImageServer related functionality to work, I have decided to merge his work into the core framework classes:
- merged CameraDriver into LiveDriver
- merged CameraAgent into Agent
- renamed FrameData to CameraData for consistency (the xxxSensor has xxxData, so CameraSensor has CameraData)


Also refactored the TcpConnection class, also to pave the way for future work on WSS by Luis:
- two types of connections are distinguished
- MessagingConnection is for text-based communication as between the Agent and UsarSim
- CameraConnection is for the ImageServer, where sent messages are plain text (e.g. acknowledgements) and the incoming data are images
- they both derive from the by now well-known TcpConnection class which has transformed into a regular base class

Other then that I also found and fixed some bugs in the image recieving logic.

Refactored and extended Sensor model:
- MessageType enum describes what kind of message was recieved (sensor/status/response/configuration/...)
- added InsSensor (new in UsarSim 3, seems to replace INU, maintains x,y,z and roll,pitch,yaw)
- added StatusSenor, gives several pieces of information of which only the Battery is of interest

Modified base Agent class:
- Agent now mounts GroundTruthSensor and StatusSensor by default

Also modified AgentController view so that it displays the ground-truth and battery status.

Integrated OpenCV into the framework:
- added C++ OpenCV libs to Third Party libs
- added OpenCVDotNet wrapper to Third Party libs
- changed reference to OpenCVDotNet in UsarLib project to make it point to the relative path
- added post-build event to UsarCommander so that it copies the C++ files to the build directory, this should fix file-not-found exceptions error

Many small things:
- made histoPic2.JPG part of the UsarLib project as Content that is copied to the build dir
- fixed GEO and CONF message handling
- fixed GETGEO and GETCONF message requests in Sensor
- fixed GeoReferencing of the produced GeoTIFF files (x-north / y-east)
- reorganized scamatching code a bit

Improved Improved FollowingBehavior: add multiple target locations by using the regular rightmouse click. Add new target location and clear all current target locations (abort and reset pathplanner). Also works for UsarClients
Note: use with caution, not fully tested

Fixed issue with (slow) external server: wait a bit before connected to WSS after agent is spawned. Connecting to quickly causes the WSS cant find the agent in USARSim.
Deploy P3AT instead of CommStation. CommStation has issues with WSS obstacle behavior. The CommStation is internally represented as an CommStation agentclass, but the P3AT is deployed with a modified USAR INIT command.
Higher camera fps and increased camera size

Major changes.  Added Comm layer that allows viewing comm strengths between all robots in UsarCommander.  This also required adding Teammate signal strength messages.  Seems to work so far, but not tested extensively (no guarantees!).

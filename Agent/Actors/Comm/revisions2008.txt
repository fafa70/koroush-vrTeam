Comm refactory:
- only the Operator had access to Comm-related information like which agents are out-of-range and in-range
- moved this functionality to CommAgent, which is the base class for Operator but also for regular agents
- as a consequence, CommAgent and derived classes have full access to all info provided by the CommActor too

Put SmartAgent in the loop:
- UsarAgent is the base class for our UsarSlamAgent and UsarSkinDetAgent
- UsarAgent used to be derived from CommAgent, but now it derives from SmartAgent
- SmartAgent in turn derives from CommAgent so it put 'in the chain'
- SmartAgent adds behavior control .... (turned off by default)

Implemented retreat behavior in case robot get out of range of the ComStation:
- pose update message has been extended such that every robot also communicates the other robots he is connected to
- therefore the pose update message is no longer directed to just the operator, but to everyone
- this enables every robot to maintain a complete connectivity matrix of who is connected with whom

This connectivity matrix is then used to:
- make the robot retreat as soon as it looses contact (directly AND indirectly) with the Operator
(- hence, as long as there is at least indirect contact the robot will be simply happy)
- this retreat is pretty dumb (read 'pragmatic' ;-p): no obstacle avoidance of any kind. It just goes until connectivity with the Operator is re-established
- so, the (reasonably valid) underlying assumption is that the robot went out of range while going straight ahead, and that it can get in range simply using reverse drive

Two things: 
- fixed double deliveries of broadcasted messages by checking timestamps
- fixed sending of cam-replies back to operator
- fixed a mini-bug in OperatorAgent

No patches are forgotten, although some patches are sent double.

To be tested more extensively.

Changed the protocol completely. LastUpdate is written at only one place: when a Commit is received. A commit is received directly when a message is received, followed by t
he Manifold Writers-block. Reduced the WSSdevice frequency to 10 seconds, because it takes up to 5 seconds before a commit returns.

Changed the protocol further. The Slave sends complete updates, the Master sends only the latest updates. Works fine, a few extra patches (one in set of 12). Only had a socket problem that should be catched.

When no target is found, the robots switch back to Random Walk behavior. In principle after two minutes the robots should go back to FrontierExploration, but have not observed this switch. Test tomorrow with debugger.

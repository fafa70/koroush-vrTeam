Update CameraAgent, CameraDriver en CameraSensor door tschmits

De CameraDriver is een wrapped thread die een CameraAgent moet bevatten met een CameraSensor:

- De CameraDriver gaat een connectie aan met zowel de USARSim server en de ImageServer
- De CameraDriver kan de imagedata uitlezen van de ImageServer en schrijft de inhoud op dit moment nog slechts weg naar cameraLog.log

- De driver.stop() methode wordt nog om onduidelijke redenen niet aangeroepen, waardoor er niet gedisconnect wordt met de ImageServer. Dit wordt nog gecorrigeerd.

Massive update:

- new NavAgent, subclass of Agent that adds navigability through a joystick

- revamped Gui all over the place
  - ManifoldView is now wrapped in a MapController which now also enables you to turn on/off individual layers 
  - RunControllerView is refactored into a TeamController 
  - AgentController is enriched with a joystick control

- The TeamController has a workflow model that mimics typical competition runs:
  - preparation stage: setup robots
  - ready stage: check configurations, load apriori file (you can switch forth and back between preparation and ready)
  - running stage: shows 20-mins countdown stopwatch, config buttons disappear and joystick controls appear
  - deliverables stage: shows 10-mins countdown stopwatch, all agents are stopped
  - done stage: run is over

Numerous bits and pieces have been refactored / debugged all over the place.

Since Tijn got all ImageServer related functionality to work, I have decided to merge his work into the core framework classes:
- merged CameraDriver into LiveDriver
- merged CameraAgent into Agent
- renamed FrameData to CameraData for consistency (the xxxSensor has xxxData, so CameraSensor has CameraData)


Also refactored the TcpConnection class, also to pave the way for future work on WSS by Luis:
- two types of connections are distinguished
- MessagingConnection is for text-based communication as between the Agent and UsarSim
- CameraConnection is for the ImageServer, where sent messages are plain text (e.g. acknowledgements) and the incoming data are images
- they both derive from the by now well-known TcpConnection class which has transformed into a regular base class

Other then that I also found and fixed some bugs in the image recieving logic.

Refactored and extended Sensor model:
- MessageType enum describes what kind of message was recieved (sensor/status/response/configuration/...)
- added InsSensor (new in UsarSim 3, seems to replace INU, maintains x,y,z and roll,pitch,yaw)
- added StatusSenor, gives several pieces of information of which only the Battery is of interest

Modified base Agent class:
- Agent now mounts GroundTruthSensor and StatusSensor by default

Also modified AgentController view so that it displays the ground-truth and battery status.

Added functionality so that each agent, regardless of which pc it is spawned, knows a-priori who his team members are and how he can communicate to them (i.e. port numbers they are listening to).
- renamed NetworkConfig to TeamConfig
- renamed NetworkConfigDialog to TeamConfigDialog
- added [team] section to TeamConfig, so now it has two sections: [network] and [team]
- the [team] section will hold a setting for the name of the operator and one for all team-members (comma-delimited)

- relaying actor commands (e.g. DRIVE commands) from operator to robot works
- atm this only works when the operator is in DIRECT contact with the robot, later on (asap) I will work on a broadcasting system that will enable the operator to communicate through intermediary robots (if time permits I hope to get to this later today)
- the setup with Operator + Proxies works, this means that the Usar Commander boots an operator and several proxies of which only the operator (usually ComStation) is actually spawned in the simulator. The 'real' counterparts of the proxies are to be spawned from the command line (using the UsarClient console app).

Debugged WSS:
- rewrote the sync protocol, the time-stamping system was flawed and caused 'gaps' to occur, should be solved now
- found a serious bug in ProxyAgent that caused it to 'think' it could not control the remote robot, while in fact it just could, this bug is also fixed
- got the path-loss values to be printed in the AgentController, really convenient
- made agents continuously communicate their current pose, so even though the operators GUI is not up-to-date, it does receive pose updates which may be enough to act in time. Note that also the pose updates will suffer from lags when the WSS is in the midst of a sync-routine.

WARNING:
- Comm will most probably NOT be backwards compatible with previous revisions
- so either update all your clients and commander, or update none

Comm update:
- command relaying through intermediaries works (DRIVE commands)
- pose update broadcasting through intermediaries works
- NOT implemented: sync through intermediaries, too complex to implement on short notice (semi is in 4 hours)

Comm improvements:
- SyncStart and SyncCommit messages now also include CurrentPose of remote robot
- benefit 1: before applying the sync, the GUI will already display the current pose of the robot
- benefit 2: after the sync is applied, the pose update will cause the GUI to refresh, so no more clicking necessary

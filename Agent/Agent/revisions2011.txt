cam conversation seems to work most of the times.. sometimes it fails and the frames are send using the regular conversation

Improved FollowingBehavior: pathplanner is now applied to the targetpoint that is added via the interface
Improved driving towards a goal: use DifferentialDrive when the angle to the target is small, otherwise turn only

Improved Improved FollowingBehavior: add multiple target locations by using the regular rightmouse click. Add new target location and clear all current target locations (abort and reset pathplanner). Also works for UsarClients
Note: use with caution, not fully tested

Fixed issue with (slow) external server: wait a bit before connected to WSS after agent is spawned. Connecting to quickly causes the WSS cant find the agent in USARSim.
Deploy P3AT instead of CommStation. CommStation has issues with WSS obstacle behavior. The CommStation is internally represented as an CommStation agentclass, but the P3AT is deployed with a modified USAR INIT command.
Higher camera fps and increased camera size

Renamed "FollowingBehaviour" to "FollowWaypoint";  removed many behaviours from GUI (to avoid mistakes in competition)

Added camera adjustment functionality (Brightness & Contrast).  Not perfect, but makes it easier to see in dark worlds.

Major changes.  Added Comm layer that allows viewing comm strengths between all robots in UsarCommander.  This also required adding Teammate signal strength messages.  Seems to work so far, but not tested extensively (no guarantees!).

Since Tijn got all ImageServer related functionality to work, I have decided to merge his work into the core framework classes:
- merged CameraDriver into LiveDriver
- merged CameraAgent into Agent
- renamed FrameData to CameraData for consistency (the xxxSensor has xxxData, so CameraSensor has CameraData)


Also refactored the TcpConnection class, also to pave the way for future work on WSS by Luis:
- two types of connections are distinguished
- MessagingConnection is for text-based communication as between the Agent and UsarSim
- CameraConnection is for the ImageServer, where sent messages are plain text (e.g. acknowledgements) and the incoming data are images
- they both derive from the by now well-known TcpConnection class which has transformed into a regular base class

Other then that I also found and fixed some bugs in the image recieving logic.

Added  functions in IAgentobserver, usarfollowAgent and the agentcontroller for a visual interface with USARCOmmander. The tracker doesn't work yet however but I had to commit in order to test on PC-UNreal.

It will not disturb the USARCOmmander if you do not use the tracker

- added some logic to SLAM so that it reverts to the odometry/INS estimate if the scanmatcher does not converge
- made some changes to CommActor to aid debugging

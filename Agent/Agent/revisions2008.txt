Comm refactory:
- only the Operator had access to Comm-related information like which agents are out-of-range and in-range
- moved this functionality to CommAgent, which is the base class for Operator but also for regular agents
- as a consequence, CommAgent and derived classes have full access to all info provided by the CommActor too

Put SmartAgent in the loop:
- UsarAgent is the base class for our UsarSlamAgent and UsarSkinDetAgent
- UsarAgent used to be derived from CommAgent, but now it derives from SmartAgent
- SmartAgent in turn derives from CommAgent so it put 'in the chain'
- SmartAgent adds behavior control .... (turned off by default)

Implemented retreat behavior in case robot get out of range of the ComStation:
- pose update message has been extended such that every robot also communicates the other robots he is connected to
- therefore the pose update message is no longer directed to just the operator, but to everyone
- this enables every robot to maintain a complete connectivity matrix of who is connected with whom

This connectivity matrix is then used to:
- make the robot retreat as soon as it looses contact (directly AND indirectly) with the Operator
(- hence, as long as there is at least indirect contact the robot will be simply happy)
- this retreat is pretty dumb (read 'pragmatic' ;-p): no obstacle avoidance of any kind. It just goes until connectivity with the Operator is re-established
- so, the (reasonably valid) underlying assumption is that the robot went out of range while going straight ahead, and that it can get in range simply using reverse drive

Re-activated BehaviorControl (see BehaviorAgent):
- TeleOperation behavior is turned on by default, the robot will not initiate any exploratory actions by itself but await for drive commands from the operator instead. What this behavior \does\ do is ensure connectivity to the Operator by initiating a retreat as soon as the robot got out-of-range.

The motions currently supported are:
- NoMotion, halts the robot upon activation and does nothing after that (so Operator is in control and robot will not interfer)
- Retreat, triggered when Operator lost contact, then robot will change to Reverse gear and try to get back in range

he Manifold Writers-block. Reduced the WSSdevice frequency to 10 seconds, because it takes up to 5 seconds before a commit returns.

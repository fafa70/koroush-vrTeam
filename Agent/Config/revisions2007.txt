Added functionality so that each agent, regardless of which pc it is spawned, knows a-priori who his team members are and how he can communicate to them (i.e. port numbers they are listening to).
- renamed NetworkConfig to TeamConfig
- renamed NetworkConfigDialog to TeamConfigDialog
- added [team] section to TeamConfig, so now it has two sections: [network] and [team]
- the [team] section will hold a setting for the name of the operator and one for all team-members (comma-delimited)

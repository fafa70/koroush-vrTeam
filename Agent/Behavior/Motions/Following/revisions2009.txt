Fixed some errors. Following works (ground follows airrobot), but only with deadreckoning for both robots. Apparently I (hanne) broke the scan-matching somehow.. Will try to fix this now.

Everything should be working now. The GroundRobot sometimes has difficulties reaching it's target, but at least the target-stack is filled by the AirRobot and followed by the Ground.

Added functionality for second range finder (since we added a tilted Hokuyo to the P2AT to detect drop-offs and obstacles at different levels from sick).
Second range finder is called TiltedScanner and is ignored everywhere except ConservativeTeleOpMotion, for now.
Changes made in every ProcessLaserRangeData throughout code.

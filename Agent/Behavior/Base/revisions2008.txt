Re-activated BehaviorControl (see BehaviorAgent):
- TeleOperation behavior is turned on by default, the robot will not initiate any exploratory actions by itself but await for drive commands from the operator instead. What this behavior \does\ do is ensure connectivity to the Operator by initiating a retreat as soon as the robot got out-of-range.

The motions currently supported are:
- NoMotion, halts the robot upon activation and does nothing after that (so Operator is in control and robot will not interfer)
- Retreat, triggered when Operator lost contact, then robot will change to Reverse gear and try to get back in range

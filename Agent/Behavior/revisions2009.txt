Commented out a print statement because index was going out of range. Didn't seem to be crucial..

This was the winning revision for the Deployment-test. We built in a hard-coded check on the signal-strength (-88.0) and activated the no-motion as soon as their SS would get below this threshold. This worked very well, but all robots (2) only checked against the CommStation. So with hopping you could get even better results.

Undo on all changes we made specifically for the Deployment-test Challenge German Open 2009.
(hence took out the hard-coded stop on the signal strength)

Added functionality for second range finder (since we added a tilted Hokuyo to the P2AT to detect drop-offs and obstacles at different levels from sick).
Second range finder is called TiltedScanner and is ignored everywhere except ConservativeTeleOpMotion, for now.
Changes made in every ProcessLaserRangeData throughout code.

This was the winning revision for the Deployment-test. We built in a hard-coded check on the signal-strength (-88.0) and activated the no-motion as soon as their SS would get below this threshold. This worked very well, but all robots (2) only checked against the CommStation. So with hopping you could get even better results.

Undo on all changes we made specifically for the Deployment-test Challenge German Open 2009.
(hence took out the hard-coded stop on the signal strength)

Created Framework for writing of DeploymentMotion.
Added auto-backup of Map and Victim Files, currently backing up every 20 seconds, seems to work but still to be tested.

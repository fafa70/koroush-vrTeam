Lotsa changes:
- moved Manifold data structure to Agent project
- got WSS to work such that any pair of Agents will try to have an open connection whenever they are within range
- got Agents to submit manifold data over the wire (Patches)

Victim stuff works:
- victims observations are stored on the Manifold
- and they are nicely rendered in the map
- 2 new layers were added for this purpose; VictimsLayer and VictimReportsLayer

- agents now also communicate poses so that the Operator can render the agents in the Manifold
- resync timeout set to 1 sec, results in faster feed-back from agent to operator

added real-time pose tracking to manifold view, it doesn't get any faster than this.

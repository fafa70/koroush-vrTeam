Lotsa changes:
- moved Manifold data structure to Agent project
- got WSS to work such that any pair of Agents will try to have an open connection whenever they are within range
- got Agents to submit manifold data over the wire (Patches)

- Comm works (WSS), huge refactory and numerous little improvements
- refactored OperatorAgent
- introduced some extension thresholds for ManifoldSLAM

Added ClearSpaceLayer
- manifold image paints cleared areas in solid green, according to the map delivery rules
- the area that falls within the victsensors view is cleared automatically
- see also the clearFov and clearRange properties on the ClearSpaceLayer class

Victim stuff works:
- victims observations are stored on the Manifold
- and they are nicely rendered in the map
- 2 new layers were added for this purpose; VictimsLayer and VictimReportsLayer

- modified VictimObservation to catch only head and chest to prevent multiple observations per single victim
- modified skindetector to higher positive skin threshold
- modified ManifoldSlam to prevent false single victim part positives (like a 'head' in a police car's wheels...)

Redesigned map saving routines:
- one layer with the map, exactly according to map-scoring rules
- one additional layer with victim reports (funky annotations with position, name and parts info)
- and another additional layer with the axes (minor importance, but since I was into it anyways ...)

Merged recent changes from Tijn, not sure if I did that correctly. 
- NEEDS VERIFICATION!

implemented a speed-up in the Weighted Scanmatcher. Did not want to mess with the current implementation (yet), so put it in a subclass called FastWeightedScanMatcher. The performance boost is about 20%.

Also reverted all Matrix and Vector classes to work with Doubles again.

- fixed apriori handling
- use thumbnail images in GeoTiffLayer to speed up rendering, it does speed up but some apriori files are simply too big
- implemented another speed up in map saving
- returned to default gdi+ coords system in ManifoldView again
- fixed text rendering in geo referenced mode (90 degrees rotated)
- fixed a bug in PatchMemento that would cause syncs to fail
- numerous little things ...

- agents now also communicate poses so that the Operator can render the agents in the Manifold
- resync timeout set to 1 sec, results in faster feed-back from agent to operator

Add min-range and max-range check to manifold rendering. Out-of-range values will no longer result in black dots.

Made the robot's path Maroon (Flavour DarkRed, pure in blue and green channels). Also modified Load of AprioriFile, but should be further tested.

Added advanced apriori analysis functionality:
- using Aforge image library (http://code.google.com/p/aforge/)
- individual apriori-layers can be turned on and off now

Chosen Chartreuse (RGB #7FFF00) as path-colour, because a path is per definition cleared. Cleared is indicated in the green channel #00FF00, the path should be indicate with a shade of red (< #FF0000). The result looks nice, the path is clearly visible, but only when you take notice of it: http://staff.science.uva.nl/~arnoud/research/roboresc/Robocup2007/chartreuse.jpg

Improved axes layer, now it also render the x- and y-values at every 5m.

Added thumbnail option to BufferedLayer in an attempt to improve rendering performance:
- this effects the FreeSpaceLayer (white), ClearedLayer (green) and ObservationsLayer (black dots)
- quality of the visualization degrades noticeably, so when the map is saved on disk the thumbnail option will be ignored, so maps saved on disk will always be full-quality
- creating the thumbnail is a trade-off: rendering speed should improve, but creating the thumb also costs CPU cycles. I'm not sure if and when the thumb is actually a benefit in CPU-terms, so I added a flag that enables to turn it off easily again.

added real-time pose tracking to manifold view, it doesn't get any faster than this.

Added FastFreeSpaceLayer:
- the regular FreeSpaceLayer plots the individual scan beams (usually 181 lines)
- this may slow down the ManifoldView as more agents contribute to the shared map
- the FastFreeSpaceLayer constructs a circle based on the max-range of the laser range scanner and intersects this with all observed obstacles. The result is a single polygon.
- the idea (assumption) is that rendering a single polygon is much faster than rendering 181 lines
- this assumption is NOT verified yet, but was based on the observation that the ClearSpaceLayer renders much faster than the regular FreeSpaceLayer, and the ClearSpaceLayer is based on a single polygon too ...

- fixed a small bug in FastFreeSpaceLayer
- added and tested speed-up and speed-down buttons to AgentController
- set rotational speed back to .5, it was too hard to get between cars with .8

- Manifold: fixed VictLog file bug
- Layers: included exception catch for rendering of victdata at point {-1.#IND, -1.#INF} - an unresolved bug atm

Disabled anti-aliasing in BufferedLayer
- this effects free-space, clear-space and observations layer
- so the jury should be able to score our maps automatically as all colors remain 'pure' now

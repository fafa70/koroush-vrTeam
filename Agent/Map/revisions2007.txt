Lotsa changes:
- moved Manifold data structure to Agent project
- got WSS to work such that any pair of Agents will try to have an open connection whenever they are within range
- got Agents to submit manifold data over the wire (Patches)

Added ClearSpaceLayer
- manifold image paints cleared areas in solid green, according to the map delivery rules
- the area that falls within the victsensors view is cleared automatically
- see also the clearFov and clearRange properties on the ClearSpaceLayer class

Victim stuff works:
- victims observations are stored on the Manifold
- and they are nicely rendered in the map
- 2 new layers were added for this purpose; VictimsLayer and VictimReportsLayer

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r601 | tschmits | 2007-07-01 04:43:16 +0200 (Sun, 01 Jul 2007) | 3 lines

- modified VictimObservation to catch only head and chest to prevent multiple observations per single victim
- modified skindetector to higher positive skin threshold
- modified ManifoldSlam to prevent false single victim part positives (like a 'head' in a police car's wheels...)

Redesigned map saving routines:
- one layer with the map, exactly according to map-scoring rules
- one additional layer with victim reports (funky annotations with position, name and parts info)
- and another additional layer with the axes (minor importance, but since I was into it anyways ...)

Merged recent changes from Tijn, not sure if I did that correctly. 
- NEEDS VERIFICATION!

implemented a speed-up in the Weighted Scanmatcher. Did not want to mess with the current implementation (yet), so put it in a subclass called FastWeightedScanMatcher. The performance boost is about 20%.

Also reverted all Matrix and Vector classes to work with Doubles again.

- fixed apriori handling
- use thumbnail images in GeoTiffLayer to speed up rendering, it does speed up but some apriori files are simply too big
- implemented another speed up in map saving
- returned to default gdi+ coords system in ManifoldView again
- fixed text rendering in geo referenced mode (90 degrees rotated)
- fixed a bug in PatchMemento that would cause syncs to fail
- numerous little things ...

- agents now also communicate poses so that the Operator can render the agents in the Manifold
- resync timeout set to 1 sec, results in faster feed-back from agent to operator

Chosen Chartreuse (RGB #7FFF00) as path-colour, because a path is per definition cleared. Cleared is indicated in the green channel #00FF00, the path should be indicate with a shade of red (< #FF0000). The result looks nice, the path is clearly visible, but only when you take notice of it: http://staff.science.uva.nl/~arnoud/research/roboresc/Robocup2007/chartreuse.jpg

Debugged WSS:
- rewrote the sync protocol, the time-stamping system was flawed and caused 'gaps' to occur, should be solved now
- found a serious bug in ProxyAgent that caused it to 'think' it could not control the remote robot, while in fact it just could, this bug is also fixed
- got the path-loss values to be printed in the AgentController, really convenient
- made agents continuously communicate their current pose, so even though the operators GUI is not up-to-date, it does receive pose updates which may be enough to act in time. Note that also the pose updates will suffer from lags when the WSS is in the midst of a sync-routine.

Added thumbnail option to BufferedLayer in an attempt to improve rendering performance:
- this effects the FreeSpaceLayer (white), ClearedLayer (green) and ObservationsLayer (black dots)
- quality of the visualization degrades noticeably, so when the map is saved on disk the thumbnail option will be ignored, so maps saved on disk will always be full-quality
- creating the thumbnail is a trade-off: rendering speed should improve, but creating the thumb also costs CPU cycles. I'm not sure if and when the thumb is actually a benefit in CPU-terms, so I added a flag that enables to turn it off easily again.

r644 | baslamet | 2007-07-05 13:56:31 +0200 (Thu, 05 Jul 2007) | 6 lines

Added FastFreeSpaceLayer:
- the regular FreeSpaceLayer plots the individual scan beams (usually 181 lines)
- this may slow down the ManifoldView as more agents contribute to the shared map
- the FastFreeSpaceLayer constructs a circle based on the max-range of the laser range scanner and intersects this with all observed obstacles. The result is a single polygon.
- the idea (assumption) is that rendering a single polygon is much faster than rendering 181 lines
- this assumption is NOT verified yet, but was based on the observation that the ClearSpaceLayer renders much faster than the regular FreeSpaceLayer, and the ClearSpaceLayer is based on a single polygon too ...

Disabled anti-aliasing in BufferedLayer
- this effects free-space, clear-space and observations layer
- so the jury should be able to score our maps automatically as all colors remain 'pure' now

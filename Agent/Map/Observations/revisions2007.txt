Victim stuff works:
- victims observations are stored on the Manifold
- and they are nicely rendered in the map
- 2 new layers were added for this purpose; VictimsLayer and VictimReportsLayer

- modified VictimObservation to catch only head and chest to prevent multiple observations per single victim
- modified skindetector to higher positive skin threshold
- modified ManifoldSlam to prevent false single victim part positives (like a 'head' in a police car's wheels...)

Redesigned map saving routines:
- one layer with the map, exactly according to map-scoring rules
- one additional layer with victim reports (funky annotations with position, name and parts info)
- and another additional layer with the axes (minor importance, but since I was into it anyways ...)

Merged recent changes from Tijn, not sure if I did that correctly. 
- NEEDS VERIFICATION!

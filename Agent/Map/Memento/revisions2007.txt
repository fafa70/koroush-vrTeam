Lotsa changes:
- moved Manifold data structure to Agent project
- got WSS to work such that any pair of Agents will try to have an open connection whenever they are within range
- got Agents to submit manifold data over the wire (Patches)

Debugged WSS:
- rewrote the sync protocol, the time-stamping system was flawed and caused 'gaps' to occur, should be solved now
- found a serious bug in ProxyAgent that caused it to 'think' it could not control the remote robot, while in fact it just could, this bug is also fixed
- got the path-loss values to be printed in the AgentController, really convenient
- made agents continuously communicate their current pose, so even though the operators GUI is not up-to-date, it does receive pose updates which may be enough to act in time. Note that also the pose updates will suffer from lags when the WSS is in the midst of a sync-routine.

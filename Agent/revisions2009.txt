fixed 2 things in the Agent.vb to make the AirRobot work again. And changed the turning controls for the AirRobot; it was set hardcoded to 0.3 but i've made it to be the speed you set in the GUI divided by 10. (because TURNING should be much slower than FLYING up/down/front/back/left/right).

Small bugfix in FrontierExploration to ignore empty infos.

This was the winning revision for the Deployment-test. We built in a hard-coded check on the signal-strength (-88.0) and activated the no-motion as soon as their SS would get below this threshold. This worked very well, but all robots (2) only checked against the CommStation. So with hopping you could get even better results.

Day 1 of RoboCup2009
- Minor bugfixes to existing NewTargetLocationMessage functionality, not tested
- Added interface to Kenaf robot, can raise and lower flippers -- works ok, but robot jumps a bit when first driving/reversing, maybe a robot parameter to be changed in config files
- Added Deploy button, next to AllTele, AllAuto buttons

* This version works with view connected to spawn-number. 
* If you want robots with spawn-numbers higher than a Kenaf, you should leave one robot spawnnumber unused for the additional camera on the Kenaf (p2at1, kenaf2, airrobot4).

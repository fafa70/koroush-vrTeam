fixed 2 things in the Agent.vb to make the AirRobot work again. And changed the turning controls for the AirRobot; it was set hardcoded to 0.3 but i've made it to be the speed you set in the GUI divided by 10. (because TURNING should be much slower than FLYING up/down/front/back/left/right).

ComputeArea is now only done in SaveMapDialog 
* ComputeArea was locking every 20 seconds the manifold and manifoldImage
* Depending on the size of the map, this locking could be several seconds

Day 1 of RoboCup2009
- Minor bugfixes to existing NewTargetLocationMessage functionality, not tested
- Added interface to Kenaf robot, can raise and lower flippers -- works ok, but robot jumps a bit when first driving/reversing, maybe a robot parameter to be changed in config files
- Added Deploy button, next to AllTele, AllAuto buttons
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added ToggleMultiView for the Kenaf (could also be extended to the Talon). 
* This version works with view connected to spawn-number. 
* If you want robots with spawn-numbers higher than a Kenaf, you should leave one robot spawnnumber unused for the additional camera on the Kenaf (p2at1, kenaf2, airrobot4).

r1912 | jdehoog | 2009-07-05 00:16:14 +0200 (Sun, 05 Jul 2009) | 1 line

Minor temporary changes to some buttons in the GUI (want to take pictures with AirRobot).  Also added some try-catch in quad tree to prevent crash where it seemed to happen regularly, just in case.
